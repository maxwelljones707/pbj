My personal favorite recipe
Crunchy PB. I prefer super crunchy
Strawberry Jam. I prefer Blueberry or grape! I also like fig jam!
Banana
Bread (I like potato bread. Whole wheat is better)
1. Toast your bread
2. Coat both sides with PB but use enough just to coat both sides
3. Spread Jam. More Jam is Key
4. Layer banana slices in the middle. 
5. Cut into triangles and enjoy! I recommend sourdough bread
I also like to put nutella in my pb&j
